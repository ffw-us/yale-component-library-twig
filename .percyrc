    # What should be excluded?
    # - Anything that is simply a representation of a base or "primitive" token
    # should be excluded. They will be represented in the larger components that
    # implement them anyway.
    # - Anything where the StoryBook display is dynamic (meaning it
    # automatically updates when new tokens are added upstream) like the colors,
    # we don't want updates in the tokens repo to flag a regression here unless
    # it changes an existing molecule/organism etc.

    # Type Faces/Scales are used directly and only by Heading/Body Styles. So,
    # there isn't much need to test them in isolation.

    # Images are random so we're hiding them with `percy-css`. So, in isolation
    # The only thing we'd be testing is the documentation around them.

    # The Footer and Header organisms demo all of their color options in the
    # respective "Examples" story, so we can skip the base ones with controls.

    # The Placeholder is a Storybook only component. Not worth testing.

    # The smallest vertical padding change at the top of a page causes apparent
    # regressions throughout. So, testing full pages isn't very helpful.
